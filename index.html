                Ensuring that your website or open web application is secure is critical. Even
                simple bugs in your code can result in private information being leaked, and bad
                people are out there trying to find ways to steal data. The web security-oriented
                articles listed here provide information that may help you secure your site and its
                code from attacks and data theft.

                Content Security Policy (CSP)

                <div class="articles__text">
                  Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect
                  and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and
                  data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft, to
                  site defacement, to malware distribution. CSP is designed to be fully backward
                  compatible (except CSP version 2 where there are some explicitly-mentioned
                  inconsistencies in backward compatibility; more details
                  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/">here</a> section 1.1). Browsers that don't
                  support it still work with servers that implement it, and vice-versa: browsers
                  that don't support CSP ignore it, functioning as usual, defaulting to the standard
                  same-origin policy for web content. If the site doesn't offer the CSP header,
                  browsers likewise use the standard same-origin policy. To enable CSP, you need to
                  configure your web server to return the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header.
                  (Sometimes you may see mentions of the
                  <code>X-Content-Security-Policy</code> header, but that's an older version and you
                  don't need to specify it anymore.)

                <div class="articles__text">
                  The security of any connection using Transport Layer Security (TLS) is heavily
                  dependent upon the cipher suites and security parameters selected. This article's
                  goal is to help you make these decisions to ensure the confidentiality and
                  integrity communication between client and server. The Mozilla Operations Security
                  (OpSec) team

                  with reference configurations for servers. The Transport Layer Security (TLS)
                  protocol is the standard for enabling two networked applications or devices to
                  exchange information privately and robustly. Applications that use TLS can choose
                  their security parameters, which can have a substantial impact on the security and
                  reliability of data. This article provides an overview of TLS and the kinds of
                  decisions you need to make when securing your content.

                    <div class="articles__text">
                      When HTTPS was introduced, it was based on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2.0, a
                      technology introduced by Netscape. It was updated to SSL 3.0 not long after,
                      and as its usage expanded, it became clear that a common, standard encryption
                      technology needed to be specified to ensure interoperability among all web
                      browsers and servers. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specified TLS
                      1.0 in RFC 2246 in January, 1999. The current version of TLS is 1.3 (RFC
                      8446). Despite the fact that the web now uses TLS for encryption, many people
                      still refer to it as "SSL" out of habit. Although TLS can be used on top of
                      any low-level transport protocol, the original goal of the protocol was to
                      encrypt HTTP traffic. HTTP encrypted using TLS is commonly referred to as
                      HTTPS. TLS-encrypted web traffic is by convention exchanged on port 443 by
                      default, while unencrypted HTTP uses port 80 by default. HTTPS remains an
                      important use case for TLS.

              <div class="articles__text">
                An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server
                sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to
                the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if
                two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It
                remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
                <br />
                Cookies are mainly used for three purposes: <br />
                <p>Session management</p>
                Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember
                <p>Personalization</p>
                User preferences, themes, and other settings
                <p>Tracking</p>
                Recording and analyzing user behavior
                <br />
                Cookies were once used for general client-side storage. While this made sense when
                they were the only way to store data on the client, modern storage APIs are now
                recommended. Cookies are sent with every request, so they can worsen performance
                (especially for mobile data connections). Modern APIs for client storage are the Web
                Storage API (localStorage and sessionStorage) and IndexedDB.
              </div>

              <div class="header-block__subtitle">Window.localStorage</div>

              <div class="articles__text">
                The <code>localStorage</code> read-only property of the
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window"><code>window</code></a> interface allows you to
                access a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage"><code>Storage</code></a> object for
                the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document"><code>Document</code></a
                >'s <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin">origin</a>; the stored data is saved
                across browser sessions.

                <code>localStorage</code> is similar to
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage" title="sessionStorage"
                  ><code>sessionStorage</code></a
                >, except that while <code>localStorage</code> data has no expiration time,
                <code>sessionStorage</code> data gets cleared when the page session ends — that is,
                when the page is closed. (<code>localStorage</code> data for a document loaded in a
                "private browsing" or "incognito" session is cleared when the last "private" tab is
                closed.)
              </div>
              <div class="header-block__subtitle">Description</div>
              <div class="articles__text">
                The keys and the values stored with <code>localStorage</code> are <em>always</em> in
                the UTF-16
                <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString"><code>DOMString</code></a> format, which
                uses two bytes per character. As with objects, integer keys are automatically
                converted to strings.

                <code>localStorage</code> data
                <strong>is specific to the protocol of the document</strong>. In particular, for a
                site loaded over HTTP (e.g., <code>http://example.com</code>),
                <code>localStorage</code> returns a different object than
                <code>localStorage</code> for the corresponding site loaded over HTTPS (e.g.,
                <code>https://example.com</code>). For documents loaded from <code>file:</code> URLs
                (that is, files opened in the browser directly from the user's local filesystem,
                rather than being served from a web server) the requirements for
                <code>localStorage</code> behavior are undefined and may vary among different
                browsers. In all current browsers, <code>localStorage</code> seems to return a
                different object for each <code>file:</code> URL. In other words, each
                <code>file:</code> URL seems to have its own unique local-storage area. But there
                are no guarantees about that behavior, so you shouldn't rely on it because, as
                mentioned above, the requirements for <code>file:</code> URLs remains undefined. So
                it's possible that browsers may change their <code>file:</code> URL handling for
                <code>localStorage</code> at any time. In fact some browsers <em>have</em> changed
                their handling for it over time.
